# Concentration Time and Lag Time Python Programm

The programm calculate concentration time and lag time of a shapefile with watersheeds with the respective attributes

## What is Time of Concentration ?

Time of concentration (Tc) is the time required for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point in the watershed to the outlet. The hydraulically
most distant point is the point with the longest travel time to the watershed outlet, and not necessarily the point with the longest flow distance to the outlet. Time
of concentration is generally applied only to surface runoff and may be computed using many different methods. Time of concentration will vary depending
upon slope and character of the watershed and the flow path.

# What is Lag Time?
Lag is the delay between the time runoff from a rainfall event over a watershed begins until runoff reaches its maximum peak. Conceptually, lag may be thought
of as a weighted time of concentration where, if for a given storm, the watershed is divided into bands of area (fig. 15â€“2), the travel times from the centroids of
the areas to the main watershed outlet

# How work the code?

the code has one entry, wichi is a shapefile, it has to contain the respective fileds with the same name as in the programm in order to calculate all the equations.


# *Let check the code*
